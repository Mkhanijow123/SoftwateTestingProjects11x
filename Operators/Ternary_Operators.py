x =10
y =20

print("x is greater"  if x > y else "Y is greater ")


# another way:

# if  x< y:
#     print("x is greater")
# else:
#     print("Y is greater")

# Logic building formula :
# User input i/p -->data type -->int
#o/p ->string -> user if he can go or not

#step 2 : Rough logic
#age > 21 "print can go "
#age < 21 "print can't go "

#step3 : write the logic

#step 4: check for the edge cases

#step 5: Optimize the code
